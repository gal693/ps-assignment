# Issues Fixed

  - Wrong api url.
    While debugging using Google DevTools, I have witnessed 404 errors that was raised by the GET request.
    This led me to check the services, there I found out that the api url was faulty.
  - 'HandleFavorite' function did not delt with empty case scenario.
    I added the solution which was trivial.

## Added Functionality 

  - Abillity to clear all favorites that were chosen.
  - Abillity to show only favorites chosen.
  - Abillity to go back 'Home' where all the movies are shown.
